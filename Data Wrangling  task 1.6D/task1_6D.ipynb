    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise explores how SQL and pandas each tackle common data operations—filtering, joining, grouping, and sorting—while highlighting their distinct philosophies. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a declarative, set-based language designed for querying relational databases, where you specify what result you want without detailing the steps to get it. In contrast, pandas is a procedural Python library that manipulates in-memory tables through explicit, step-by-step commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "By converting practical SQL queries into their pandas equivalents, we’ve illuminated how concepts translate between these two environments. This side-by-side comparison not only clarifies their syntactic and performance trade-offs but also underscores each tool’s strengths—SQL’s succinct expression of complex joins and aggregates versus pandas’s seamless integration with Python and its rich data-processing ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sections that follow, you’ll find each SQL statement paired with its pandas counterpart, accompanied by notes on structural adjustments, performance considerations, and readability enhancements.\n"

    "## 1.1 Connection with the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, we’ll ingest multiple CSV files into an SQLite database so that they become queryable relational tables—laying the groundwork for direct SQL analyses and side-by-side comparisons with pandas. The accompanying Python script works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Database connection:**  Opens (or creates) my_database.db via SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Type mapping:** Uses a helper function to translate pandas dtypes (e.g., int64 → INTEGER, float64 → REAL, others → TEXT) into SQLite column types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **File discovery:** Locates every .csv file in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data loading:** Reads each CSV into a pandas DataFrame—skipping malformed rows and ignoring lines that start with #.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Schema generation:** Inspects each DataFrame’s columns and dtypes to build a matching CREATE TABLE statement dynamically, so each CSV becomes its own table.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Table population:** Calls df.to_sql() to bulk-insert the DataFrame’s rows into the newly created SQLite table.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Cleanup:** Commits all transactions and closes the database connection once every file has been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this setup, your CSV files now live as SQL tables, ready for efficient querying and direct comparison with equivalent pandas operations.\n"

    "### CONCULSION\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provided practical insight into how SQL and pandas complement each other in data analysis workflows. SQL’s declarative syntax excels at concise, set-based operations on relational data, whereas pandas delivers a programmatic, in-memory approach that’s ideal for exploratory tasks and complex transformations within Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translating each SQL statement into its pandas equivalent deepened my understanding of relational logic—mapping SELECT and WHERE to .loc and boolean masks, GROUP BY to .groupby().agg(), JOIN to .merge(), and ORDER BY to .sort_values(). This exercise underscored the importance of data type integrity, null-value handling, and column alignment, details that pandas exposes more explicitly than SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, tackling this assignment enhanced my fluency in both languages and sharpened my ability to choose the right tool for any given problem. It has boosted my confidence in designing hybrid SQL–Python workflows, a common pattern in real-world data science and analytics projects.\n"
