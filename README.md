# Data Wrangling Tasks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and sample datasets used for several data wrangling exercises. Each task explores a different aspect of preparing and processing real data using Python.

## Repository Structure

- **Data Wrangling Deakin/Task 1** – Introductory notebook for Task 1.1
- **Data Wrangling Task 1.3P** – NumPy-based statistical calculations using NHANES anthropometric data
- **Data_warngling_task_1.5P** – Pandas exploration of a weather dataset
- **Data Wrangling  task 1.6D** – Pandas vs SQL comparison; includes datasets and scripts

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo and start Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
2. Open the notebook for the task you are interested in.
3. For Task 1.6D you can also run the Python script directly:
   ```bash
   python 'Data Wrangling  task 1.6D/task1_6D.py'
   ```
   It loads the compressed CSV files into a SQLite database and runs comparisons between SQL queries and equivalent pandas code.

## Datasets

Each task folder includes the datasets used in the notebooks. Some CSV files are compressed with Gzip. For Task 1.6D the dataset is sourced from the `nycflights13` package.

## Notes

The notebooks were created for coursework at Deakin University. File paths include spaces to match the original assignments.
