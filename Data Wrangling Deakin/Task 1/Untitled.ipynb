    "In this section, we focus on preparing the **BTC-to-USD daily closing price** data for analysis. The dataset was obtained from **Yahoo Finance**, specifically from the *Historical Data* tab on the BTC-USD page. We selected the date range from **January 1, 2023, to the current date**, set the frequency to **Daily**, and downloaded the file in **CSV format**.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "After preparing the dataset, we proceeded to load it into Python for further analysis. We used **NumPy's `genfromtxt`** function to read the CSV file and store the extracted values in a variable named `rates`. This method allows for efficient loading of numerical data into a NumPy array, which is essential for performing mathematical and statistical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `genfromtxt` function is particularly useful because it can handle missing values and irregularities while reading text-based data. It automatically parses the input and converts it into a structured NumPy array, enabling a smooth transition from raw data to a format suitable for analysis. By utilizing `genfromtxt`, we ensure that our BTC-to-USD closing price data is ready for further computation and exploration."
